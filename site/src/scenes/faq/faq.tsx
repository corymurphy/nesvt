            This video gives a very good over view of the sport of autocross and
            is about 9 minutes long.

            Part of what makes autocross so inexpensive is the shared work load.
            Each person is assigned a work station. You will most likely be
            assigned a station on the course where you will reset hit cones,
            call them in and flag cars in case of an issue. Each person works
            for one session and drives the other. We have 4 of these sessions
            and your participation in the working portion is vital to the
            operation of the event. If you do not show up to work your station
            then the event stops until we can find you or a replacement. This is
            the golden rule of autocross, you must work your assignment, leaving
            early without cause will ensure that you are not welcomed back at
            our or anyone else's events.

              Both directions converge at a Rotary in Ayer at the junctions of
              routes 110, 111, and 2A. There is a Ford dealer (Gervais), a
              Wendy's, and a McDonald's at this rotary.

            <p className="lead">
              From the rotary, proceed west on routes 2A and 111. This will take
              you to Ayer center, and at about one mile routes 2A and 111 turn
              right; so will you. Proceed past Bishop Road on the left. Stay on
              Rt 2A which forks to the left for approx another mile. The north
              entrance to the airstrip is on the left. There should be a sign
              marking the entrance. There are motorcycle driving classNamees on
              the lower lot to the right as you enter. Our event is up the hill
              to the left. Look for the person with the waivers at the top of
              the hill. There are a Dunkin Donuts and a Cumberland Farms between
              the Ayer center and the gate and there are gas stations along the
              route as well. You can find Moore Army Air Strip in Google maps
              just north of Ayer center. The entrance is right behind the tower
